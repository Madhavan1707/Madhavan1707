# Hi, Iâ€™m Madhavan â€” Android (Java) Developer | Telematics & Connected Mobility

I build robust Android services and connected mobility featuresâ€”MQTT-based telemetry, AIDL-driven IPC, background services, and secure, low-latency data pipelines. Previously delivered real-time tracking (<50ms), safety workflows (SOS/eCall/bCall), and production-ready app features.

**What I work with**
- Android (Java, Kotlin), Android SDK, Services, BroadcastReceivers, AIDL, WorkManager
- Retrofit/OkHttp, MQTT, JSON/Protobuf, Room/SQLite, Firebase
- Testing: JUnit, Mockito, Espresso | CI: GitHub Actions
- Perf & security: Offline-first, compression (Zstd), AES, caching

**Highlights**
- Built real-time vehicle connectivity (MQTT + Protobuf + AES + Zstd) with sub-50ms latency.
- Designed Android background services for continuous CAN/telematics data capture and reliable delivery.
- Shipped features with measurable wins (crash rate â†“, latency â†“) via profiling, threading, and rigorous tests.

**Featured Projects**
- ðŸŽ¬ **Trending-Movies-App** â€” MVVM, Retrofit, RxJava2, Room, Dagger; offline caching & rich details view.

**Currently**
- Deepening Android telematics (MQTT resilience, AIDL IPC, services), and stronger CI/CD for mobile.
